Game Summary: This was supposed to be a simple survey mission--land on the third moon of Alkarra, take some photos, maybe a soil sample or two, and get back to Starbase 7c before the long weekend. But as soon as you land, you find a world stranger and more dangerous than anyone back at base could have known. The elements have embued you with some sort of power, and all the beings of the world seem to hum and bellow a singular, alien song.
